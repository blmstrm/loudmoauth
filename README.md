# Loudmoauth
Loudmoauth is ment to be a library for managing ouath2 client tokens independently of what service one is using.

## Usage

###Set the oauth2 parameters `set-oauth-params`
Supply a map with the following keys:
  ```Clojure
  {:base-url "https://www.example.com"
  :client-id "34jfkdl3...4fjdl2"
  :redirect-uri "https://www.example.com/callback"
  :scope "do-one-thing do-another-thing"
  :custom-query-params {:likes-cake "Yes"}
  :client-secret "23dj2k3k23kd...2312323s2s"}
```
as an argument to the `set-oauth-params` function.

###Retrieve your token
To retrieve your token call the `token` function.

#### Custom query parameters `:custom-query-params`
If the oauth2 service provider demands or gives you the possibility of any custom query parameters please include them in the map associated with the key `:custom-query-params`. This key is optional, so feel free to leave it out.



### When the token expires
Loudmoauth tries to update your token for you whenever the token has reached its expiry time.
